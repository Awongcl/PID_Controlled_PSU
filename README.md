Welcome, the goal of this project is to build a practical power supply for electronics.
### Requirements:
1. Voltage output from range 1.8V to 15V, which is most suitable for electronics projects.
2. Limited current feature, to protect smaller devices and mistakes can be forgiving.
3. One terminal
4. Small can compact, safe to use at the same time.

### Approach:
Using the idea of controllable buck converters, we can convert our main voltage source down to any voltages we want.
